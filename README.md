*For now this is meant to be used as an example and is not yet a fully runnable project on its own. The server setup itself is not in the project.*

The StorageAuth helper class contains working code for authorizing against Google Cloud Storage from an App Engine Standard environment to create Signed Upload URLs where clients can upload their images.
